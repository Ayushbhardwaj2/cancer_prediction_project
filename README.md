üß¨ Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning:

                   This project applies Machine Learning models to predict whether a tumor is Benign (B) or Malignant (M) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. 
                  It demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.

Project Overview:

                  Load and explore the Breast Cancer dataset.
                  
                  Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis.
                  
                  Train and evaluate ML models such as:
                  
                  Logistic Regression
                  
                  Decision Tree
                  
                  Random Forest
                  
                  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
                  
                  Compare models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
                  
                  Visualize results using plots and a Confusion Matrix.
Results:

              Achieved an accuracy of ~96% on test data.
